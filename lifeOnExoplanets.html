        <h1>Life on Exoplanets?</h1>

        <div class="text-block1">

                Central to the quest for potential life in the universe is exoplanets. Several experiments and methods
                have evolved over the years in the field of astrobiology which have refined our ability to detect these
                distant worlds and analyze them for signs of life.The Goldilocks Zone refers to the orbital region
                around a star where conditions might be optimal for
                liquid water, a vital ingredient for life as we know it, on a planets’ surface (Brennan, 2023).
                Typically, the distance is between 0.95 and 1.37 astronomical units (AU) from the planets Sun. Although
                these boundaries may vary depending on factors such as the planets’ atmosphere, composition, and
                presence of greenhouse gases. In other star systems with different types of stars, the Goldilocks zone
                would be located at different distances from the star. Exoplanets residing in this zone, like our Earth,
                are of great interest to astrobiologists because of the potential they hold for hosting
                extra-terrestrial life.

                Presently, the primary method employed in the search for exoplanets is The Transit Method.
                The Transit Method is one of the keystone techniques in exoplanet detection. As an exoplanet orbits and
                crosses in front of its host star from our point of view here on Earth, its causes a minuscule but
                detectable dimming in the star’s light (Brennan, 2023). The Kepler Space Telescope, which is famous for
                its exoplanet discoveries in various star systems, predominantly utilises the Transit Method. The
                Transit Method deeply intertwines with my academic study of Computer Science. Computer Science is all
                about data. The slight dimming of the star is captured by telescopes as data points over time,
                generating what we know as a light curve. Analysing these light curves is where computer science comes
                into play:

            <ul>
                <li><b>Data Processing:</b>The sheer volume of data captured by telescopes like Kepler is immense.
                    Efficient
                    algorithms are essential to process and filter this data, distinguishing genuine planetary transits
                    from
                    other cosmic phenomena or instrumental noise.</li>
                <li><b>Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition: </b>Given the diverse range of stars observed
                    automation
                    becomes
                    necessary. Machine learning algorithms are trained to recognize patterns of characteristic planetary
                    transits, which enhance our detection capabilities.</li>
                <li><b>Simulation: </b>Computer simulations can model and predict the characteristics of exoplanets
                    based on
                    observed light curves, providing insights into their size, orbital period, and potential atmospheric
                    components.</li>
            </ul>

                Current challenges with this method are false positives. Although scientists’ use algorithms to filter
                the data, sometimes the method can be misled by star spots or other celestial objects, leading to false
                detections. While the transit method is excellent at detecting planets, including those in or near the
                habitable zone, it does not provide direct information about a planet's habitability. It primarily helps
                astronomers discover and characterize exoplanets, including their size, orbital period, and sometimes
                even their atmosphere. To determine whether a planet in the habitable zone is truly habitable,
                additional information is needed, such as the planet's composition, atmosphere, and whether it possesses
                conditions conducive to life. Other methods, like spectroscopy and follow-up observations, are used to
                gather this information. So, while the transit method is a powerful tool for finding exoplanets, it
                doesn't directly reveal whether a planet is habitable. Drawing upon the fishbowl analogy, scientists
                often emphasize the significance of exoplanets within the Goldilocks Zone, largely influenced by our
                understanding of conditions we deem favourable for life. This focus might be a result of our limited
                perspective. It is possible that we are limiting our comprehension of life's potential by adhering too
                rigidly to the conditions we know sustain life on Earth and perhaps overlooking other planetary
                candidates. Life could plausibly exist in various regions of a star system: should we direct our
                telescopes towards areas we might not typically label as "habitable"? Relating this to my earlier
                assignment, extremophiles flourish in environments like scalding hydrothermal vents and acidic lakes.
                Similarly, life might exist on intensely hot planets outside the familiar confines of the Goldilocks
                Zone.
