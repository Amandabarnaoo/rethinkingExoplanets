        <h1>Beyond the Bowl?</h1>

                Beyond the Bowl: What do I mean by this? My recent curiosity with Stephen Hawking's work about where our
                universe began led me to read "The Grand Design," co-authored with Leonard Mlodinow, and Mlodinow's
                separate piece, "Stephen Hawking: A Memoir of Friendship and Physics". I found myself pondering deeper
                questions about our universe's origins. Are we fortunate to have just the right conditions for life on
                Earth? Or might the vastness of the universe host other life forms? One idea that resonated with me was
                the "fishbowl effect", the underlying idea has also been discussed in my Astrobiology class; this is the
                idea that a fish, due to its bowl's curved sides, perceives a skewed version of reality, governed by
                different physical laws (Hawking & Mlodinow, 2010). It suggests that our understanding of reality might
                also be limited or distorted. This prompted me to question our current understanding of life. Perhaps
                there are organisms that can survive in environments entirely different from what we're accustomed to.

                During a recent assignment, I studied extremophiles in New Zealand's hot springs, using them as
                potential analogs for life on Mars. The findings were fascinating: extremophiles are astoundingly
                resilient, thriving in conditions inhospitable to humans. Could there be other life forms existing in
                environments we haven't yet considered? My microscopic investigation of life expanded to a macroscopic
                scale: exoplanets. The "Goldilocks zone" is an intriguing concept, indicating the 'just right' distance
                from a star where liquid water—crucial for life as we know it—could exist. Yet, as extremophiles
                demonstrate, life's potential extends beyond just location. As scientists’ further study exoplanetary
                atmospheres, combined with our understanding of extremophiles, we inch closer to addressing the timeless
                question: are we alone in the universe?

                Both Hawking and Mlodinow excel at presenting deep physics concepts (although as Mlodinow stated in his
                memoir about Hawking, this was very difficult for Stephen to do – I giggled at this) in a relatable
                manner. To me, this embodies interdisciplinary knowledge— which I have learnt is the essence of
                astrobiology's nature. In my Astrobiology lectures at the University of Auckland, I've been exposed to
                various technologies used in the quest for extra-terrestrial life; many employ solid computer science
                principles. Noticing these intersections between my degree and the wonderfully exciting field of
                astrobiology has been enlightening. Such overlaps facilitate the creation of tools that might one day
                simulate exoplanetary ecosystems, refine habitable zone predictions, or even decipher extra-terrestrial
                biosignatures from afar. I read about exoplanet bio-signatures in “Exoplanet Biosignatures: A Review of
                Remotely Detectable Signs of Life” (Schwieterman, 2018). In the article, a discussion of gaseous
                biosignatures and implications of false positives led me to think about how the principles and
                technologies of computer science could be advanced to improve the experimental study in this area. Data
                from telescopes like Kepler and TESS undergo complex computational analyses (Brennan, 2023). This
                exciting juncture of computer science and astrobiology enriches both my academic pursuits of Computer
                Science and my broader exploration of potential life in the universe. Just as the richness and diversity
                of backgrounds that are unified in Auckland fascinates me, the possibility of extra-terrestrial life
                deepens this appreciation to a much larger scale. For society at large, the discovery of life elsewhere
                can redefine our understanding of interconnectedness and community. It is important to think about as it
                may push us to revaluate the copious divisions we have on Earth and appreciate that we are unified in
                our
                cosmic journey. On a universal scale, the quest for life on exoplanets and being open to different
                prerequisites for life highlight the potential tapestry of life across many galaxies. Every star could
                be a sun to another world. We on Earth, a tiny fragment of the universe, might share it with countless
                others; the discovery of this would reshape our perceived role as humanity in the cosmos.

                This study and reflective piece will explore current efforts in the field of astrobiology to search for
                life on exoplanets and its implications. Additionally, it will encourage deeper contemplation on the
                possibility that life might thrive under conditions strikingly different from what we're familiar with,
                therefore we may need to adapt and refine these current methods to accommodate the search for diverse
                life forms.
